This project is based on a Firefox Addon by Hunter Paolini: http://procon.mozdev.com/. It has been forked and the code bases are separate.

The goal of Picket-Line is to help users regulate their own web usage, the patronizing of businesses and services,
in order to support those in labor and related struggles with website providers or affiliates.

You can subscribe to lists that will automatically update you know where there are picket-lines and how you can
avoid crossing them. For example, learn more at http://digitalcitizensproject.org/
